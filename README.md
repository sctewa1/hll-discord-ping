### General

CRCON is mainly designed and developed for PC gamers. For example, it is not possible for console players to use a keyboard to enter data in  the chat window. This tool framework is mainly (but not exclusively) aimed at console players.
Most console players can open their phone and discord though! 

> [!Note] 
> The main reason for developing this tool came about for the server admins needing to unban console players.


### Basics
You must have access to a CRCON Server
You need a bearer Token to access the API of CRCON Server
You need basic knowledge about Linux and Docker
I assume that you are using folder /opt as indended for proprietary software.


Currently we can issue commands

/bans - Show recent bans
/unban - Unban a player from recent bans
/curping - Show current max ping autokick value
/setping - Set max ping autokick value (in ms)
/curscheduledtime - Show current scheduled job times and ping values
/setscheduledtime <job> <time> <ping> - Set scheduled job time and ping follow prompts
/online - Check if bot and API are running
/help - Show this help message
